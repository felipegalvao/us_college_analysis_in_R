# US Colleges Analysis

This is an analysis of US Colleges Data, meant as an exercise in my
journey to learn R and Data Science.

All the data can be found at: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

Since i'm learning and still on the beginning of my journey,
there are probably some errors and misconceptions. I would love
if anyone could point these out, so i can improve and fix these on
my future analysis.

Thanks for your attention
